# Oil-and-Gas-Emissions-Tracking

## Project Statement
- This dataset provides an in-depth look into the global CO2 emissions at the country-level, allowing for a better understanding of how much each country contributes to the global cumulative human impact on climate.

- It contains information on total emissions as well as from coal, oil, gas, cement production and flaring, and other sources.

- The data also provides a breakdown of per capita CO2 emission per country - showing which countries are leading in pollution levels and identifying potential areas where reduction efforts should be concentrated.

- This dataset is essential for anyone who wants to get informed about their own environmental footprint or conduct research on international development trends.
